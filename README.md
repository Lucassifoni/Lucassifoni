### Hiya ðŸ‘‹

I've been freelancing since 2015 doing spec discovery, design & development of web and internal projects for various clients.  

A short summary of my experiences is available here : https://lucassifoni.github.io/cv/  

Today, I'd be looking to work as part of a team on Elixir-related projects, either on the ecosystem itself or products built with it.

On the side, a bit of my optics-making can be found on GitHub too. I'd love to discuss that too, so feel free to reach out.
