### Hiya ðŸ‘‹

I've been freelancing since 2015 doing spec discovery, design & development of web and internal projects for various clients.  

A short summary of my experiences is available here : https://lucassifoni.github.io/cv/  

I'm currently working on a homebrew no-code/low-code design automation software, for which I'm building Ovo2, a functional script language that can be bidirectionnally edited with text or a visual editor. This project is a mix of Typescript + Vue & Elixir.

Today, I'd be looking to work as part of a team on Elixir-related projects, either on the ecosystem itself or products built with it.

On the side, a bit of my optics-making can be found on GitHub too. (see https://github.com/Lucassifoni/hyperbolic-200mm-f3.5- ) I'd love to discuss that too, so feel free to reach out.
