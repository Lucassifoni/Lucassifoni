### Work

I've been freelancing since 2015 doing spec discovery, planning &Â development of web and internal projects for various clients. Either solo, or with [designers](https://documents.design) & other teams.
A summary of my experiences & contact info, as well as my blog. is available here : [lucassifoni.info/](https://lucassifoni.info/).

I'm currently working on a homebrew no-code/low-code design automation software, for which I'm building Ovo2, a small script language that can be bidirectionnally edited with text or a visual editor. This project is a mix of Typescript + Vue & Elixir.

Today, I'd be looking to work as part of a team on Elixir-related projects, either on the ecosystem itself or products built with it.
Also eager to use Rust more with Elixir as it provides a nice speedup to many algorithms.

### Optics & Astronomy

A bit of my optics, telescopes or hardware fiddling can be found on GitHub (see [github.com/Lucassifoni/hyperbolic-200mm-f3.5-](https:///github.com/Lucassifoni/hyperbolic-200mm-f3.5-) ) or on instagram under the handle [@chantepierre_](https://instagram.com/chantepierre_) I'd love to discuss that too, so feel free to reach out.
